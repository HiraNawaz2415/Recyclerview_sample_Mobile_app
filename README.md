## What is RecyclerView?

**RecyclerView** is a flexible and efficient widget in Android used to display large sets of data in a scrollable list or grid. Unlike the older `ListView`, RecyclerView:

- Reuses ("recycles") item views for better performance.
- Supports different layout managers (vertical, horizontal, grid, staggered).
- Allows animations and custom decorations.
- Separates layout (`ViewHolder`) from logic (`Adapter`), improving modularity.

RecyclerView is part of the Android Jetpack `androidx` library and is widely used in modern Android development.
